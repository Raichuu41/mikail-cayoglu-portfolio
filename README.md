# Personal Portfolio by Mikail Cayoglu

## Getting Started

This portfolio is developed for personal use.
The design is inspired by Brittany Chiang, her repository can be found [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4).

The project is built using Angular 15.

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed locally. Npm is available with NodeJS in [here](https://nodejs.org/).
After npm is installed, you can install Angular CLI globally by typing the following command in your terminal.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone the repository and execute the following command inside the folder project

``` bash
npm install
```

### Serving the application for local development

Just run the start script

```
npm start
```

Or alternatively, directly run

```
ng serve
```

Wait for the compilation to complete and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) by default.
